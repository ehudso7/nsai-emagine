## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application to production:

1. **Final Pre-Deployment Check**
   ```
   npm run prepare-prod
   ```
   This runs linting, testing, and verification in sequence.

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   Ensure all environment variables are set in your production environment (.env.production or Vercel/hosting dashboard).

3. **Deploy to Production**
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```
   The CI/CD pipeline will handle testing and deployment to Vercel.

4. **Verify Post-Deployment**
   After deployment, run a final check on the production URL:
   ```
   BASE_URL=https://www.nsai-emagine.com npm run verify
   ```

## Post-Launch Monitoring

Once deployed, monitor the following:

1. **Error Tracking** - Check Sentry for any unexpected errors
2. **User Analytics** - Monitor user flow and conversion rates
3. **API Performance** - Watch for any bottlenecks or slow endpoints
4. **Subscription Metrics** - Track conversion from trial to paid accounts

## Conclusion

The NSAI Emagine platform is now technically ready for production deployment. All core functionality has been tested and verified, and the necessary infrastructure for scaling, monitoring, and maintaining the application is in place.

Next steps should focus on marketing preparation and content creation as outlined in the PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md.
